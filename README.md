# Linuxbook
A guide to build the perfect Linux notebook

## Initial thoughts
Chromebooks are great! At least from a Linux hardware support perspective because traditional devices do have proprietary hardware which might not be as well supported as we all hope. Chromebooks however should be fully compatiple with Linux because Chrome OS is nothing else than Linux. A second very important point is the security of chromebooks which can be harvested to secure your Linux system. In this guide we will turn a Lenovo Yoga C13 Chromebook to a (in my opinion) perfect Linux notebook. In the end we will end up with a fully encrypted system and a Linux distro of our choosing. Please note that this is only tested on a Lenovo Yoga C13. If there are differences on other devices please send me a pull request so that this turns into a more universal usable guide. All patches and resources you need will be contained in this repository.
